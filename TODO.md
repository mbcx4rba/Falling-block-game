1. Monitor key-presses and releases to get input at a given time rather than on-key to reduce key-repeat sluggishness
2. ~~ Split up GameState.rkt into several smaller and more managable files using the module system~~
3. Detect a game loss
4. ~~Modify tetramino rotation so that it rotates about its centre of mass (maybe simply modify the representation of a piece with an extra symbol to indicate its the pivot point and caluculate its position vector?)~~
5. Add a property to tetramino that specifies its verticle offset when added to the board
6. Add wallkicks
7. Add a level and score system
8. Add a GUI element displaying (lines cleared, level, score)
9. Maybe sound effects when ~~placing a tetramino~~ / rotating a tetramino / clearing lines
